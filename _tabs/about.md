## Hi, I'm Juan Hernandez 👋

I am a **Cybersecurity Masters Student at FIU** and **Software Engineer** with a passion for building secure, reliable systems. I believe that great software isn't just about functionality, it's about resilience and protecting the users who depend on it.

### Why I'm Writing This Blog
I started this space to transmit my knowledge and provide a helping hand to fellow developers and security enthusiasts. 

In my own journey, I’ve found myself with many obstacles. My goal is to help those who share the same passion for software devlopment and cybersecurity, I don't want to talk only about the results, I want to show how I overcame different obstacles and challenges that get you there.

I started this space to transmit my knowledge and provide a helping hand to fellow developers and security enthusiasts. 

In my own journey, I’ve found myself facing many obstacles—from configuration headaches to complex security concepts. My goal is to help those who share the same passion for software development and cybersecurity by smoothing out that learning curve. I don't just want to show the final result; I want to show how to overcome the hurdles that get you there.

### What You'll Find Here
* **Software Development**: Tips on writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
* **Security Insights**: Practical ways to integrate security into the development lifecycle.
* **Technical Walkthroughs**: Step-by-step guides on tools and concepts I've mastered along the way.
* **Cloud Progress**: Documentation of my journey into Cloud Security, currently focusing on the **Microsoft AZ-500**.

I don't just want to talk about "the what", I want to help you understand "the how." Whether you are a developer looking to write more secure code or a student starting out in security, I hope you find something valuable here.
