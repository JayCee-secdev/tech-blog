**Hello World!**

## Why I'm Here
During my journey as a **Software Engineer** and now a **Cybersecurity** Master's student at **FIU**, I have encountered and overcome many obstacles. I have realized the importance that collaboration has in today's tech world. Forums, blogs, tutorials; these are some of the many tools I have used to face the challenges of software development and cybersecurity. I want to start contributing to the community with my knowledge and my own experience.

## Transmitting Knowledge
My goal with this blog is simple: to provide a helping hand. I want to share the "how" and the "why" behind the projects I have built and the different security concepts I have mastered, like my **CompTIA Security+** certification or my current path towards the **AZ-500**. I want to give back to the community, and I hope that this blog can help you, even in the slightest way, to succeed in your tech goals!

## What's Next?
Expect to find tips, walkthroughs, and honest retrospectives on the different challenges I have faced. And remember, if you have any suggestions or questions, you can always hit me up on my social media accounts!

Stay tuned for my first technical post coming very soon!
