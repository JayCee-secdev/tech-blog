I started my Security+ journey in mid-2025. While I was excited to earn my first security certification, I didn't realize how much of a challenge lay ahead. I navigated through high and lows until the day of the examination arrived, and I couldn't be more nervous. Thankfully, all the months of hard work and lots of studying paid off. However, there are some things that could have made my learning path more comfortable, and I want to share these tips with you.

**Tips on getting you Security+**
## Define your strategy
When I started preparing for Security+, I had very surface level knowledge of cybersecurity (and this is being very generous), I knew basics of networking and had a fair share of Operating Systems practice, but thats all, and coming from an SE background my cyber specific expertise was very low. So, from the start I faced one of the biggest challenges: Knowing where to start. There were **so many sources**, so many Youtube channels telling me to do this or that, and in the end I made a lot of changes throughout my preparation (too many if I'm being honest). Therefore, I would like to give you some of the **most reliable (in my opinion) study sources**:

1. **[Professor Messer](https://www.youtube.com/@professormesser)**
I could not thank this man more, his videos are the gold standard for following the exam objectives exactly. And his live study groups are great to answer any specific doubts.

2. **[Dion Training Practice Exams](https://www.udemy.com/user/jason-dion/)**
Best for simulating the actual exam environment and tricky wording. Take these as serious as you can to emulate the real stuff!

3. **[PowerCert Animated Videos](https://www.youtube.com/@PowerCertAnimatedVideos)**
As a visual learner myself, their videos are the best to understand complex networking concepts.

4. **[Jeremy's IT Lab Packet Tracer Labs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgcGcrLKu1A&list=PLxbwE86jKRgMQ4HTuaJ7yQgA2BoNwY9ct)**
Coming from a Software Engineering background, I found that actually 'building' the networks in these labs helped the security concepts click much faster than just reading about them.

## It's all about patience
One of the most difficult parts of getting your Security+ certification is the fact that all your preparation is self-paced, you are in charge of the amount of time dedicated to studying, and getting frustrated with "not advancing enough" happens a lot when learning by yourself. You have to understand that Security+ is not a sprint, it is a marathon. Setting deadlines, having an expected date is ok, but to really see results you will need to rely on consistency rather than occasional marathon study sessions. 
> **Pro-Tip**: Consistency > Intensity. Studying 30 minutes every day is better than an 8-hour "cram session" once a week.

And remember, the discipline you will develop doesn't just help with certifications; it's the same patience required for debugging a complex script or analyzing a security log for hours.

## Create your own journey
Don't be afraid to make things different. I wrote this post to share my personal insights, but the most effective Security+ journey is the one you craft for yourself.

Whether you learn best through videos, hands-on labs, or extensive reading, lean into your strengths. That is the beauty of self-paced study: you are building your own preparation. When those efforts finally pay off, the reward feels that much greater because the process was uniquely yours.

Whether you are preparing for Security+, pursuing another certification, or chasing a personal goal, craft your own process. Be proud of the path you are creating as you continue learning, growing, and developing into a cybersecurity professional.

You are capable of incredible things. Keep pushing forward!
